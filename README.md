# snowmelt-timing-2024

## Seasonal snowmelt timing

The purpose of this project is to explore different data and methodologies that, when combined, will help us better understand seasonal snowmelt timing. Amongst other types of data, team members will be exposed to Sentinel-1 SAR data, SNOTEL data, MODIS snow products, SWE reanalysis products, and SnowEx snow pit data. This project is intentionally more flexible, if you have ideas adjacent to this work, let's find ways to build it in! **This project is a spiritual successor to the 2022 snowex hackweek project snowmelt-timing, check out our [repo](https://github.com/snowex-hackweek/snowmelt-timing) and [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1czTH2q2nH_Lf7uoYkDXu03mFaJVkOE3GxtXRAFWuBhg/edit?usp=sharing).**

### The problem

Snowmelt timing has high spatial and temporal variability, and different types of data and methodologies that attempt to measure properties of snowmelt have their own strengths and weaknesses. This project hopes to address these challanges, leveraging the strengths of disparate appraoches to better characterize the evolution of snowmelt.

## Data and Methods

### Data

Briefly describe and provide citations for the data that will be used (size, format, how to access).

Some ideas:
* Sentinel-1 C-band RTC
* MODIS snow products
* Harmonized Landsat / Sentinel-2 optical
* SnowEx snow pit data
* SNOTEL automatic weather station data
* SWE reanalysis products

### Existing methods

How would you or others traditionally try to address this problem? Provide any relevant citations to prior work.

SAR snowmelt toolbox and snow wetness tools I've built:

### Proposed methods/tools

**TBD!**

What new approaches would you like to implement for addressing your specific question(s) or application(s)?

### Additional resources or background reading

**TBD!**

Optional: links to manuscripts or technical documents providing background information, context, or other relevant information.

## Project goals and tasks

### Project goals

**TBD!**

List the specific project goals or research questions you want to answer. Think about what outcomes or deliverables you'd like to create (e.g. a series of tutorial notebooks demonstrating how to work with a dataset, results of an anaysis to answer a science question, an example of applying a new analysis method, or a new python package).

* Goal 1
* Goal 2
* ...

### Tasks

**TBD!**

What are the individual tasks or steps that need to be taken to achieve each of the project goals identified above? What are the skills that participants will need or will learn and practice to complete each of these tasks? Think about which tasks are dependent on prior tasks, or which tasks can be performed in parallel.

* Task 1 (all team members will learn to use GitHub)
* Task 2 (team members will use the scikit-learn python library)
  * Task 2a (assigned to team member A)
  * Task 2b (assigned to team member B)
* Task 3
* ...

## Project Results

**TBD!**

Use this section to briefly summarize your project results. This could take the form of describing the progress your team made to answering a research question, developing a tool or tutorial, interesting things found in exploring a new dataset, lessons learned for applying a new method, personal accomplishments of each team member, or anything else the team wants to share.

You could include figures or images here, links to notebooks or code elsewhere in the repository (such as in the [notebooks](notebooks/) folder), and information on how others can run your notebooks or code.
